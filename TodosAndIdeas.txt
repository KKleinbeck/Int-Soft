Change the role of "Args"
  With multiple different models it will now be awkward to define Hyperparameters in one object with
  _fixed_ entries. Rather make it a Dictionary.
  Pros:
  * Models can, during creation, lookup whether their respective Hyperparameters exist.
  * Not needed Hyperparameters do not need to be created
  * Args can thus be adapted more freely
  * I rely on one less external library

  Cons:
  * Switching between models is still ugly

Boilerplate code for the Models
  Currently I have to give a trainable, gpu and pretty print function for every model I create.
  This is bad design and a macro should handle this. Find a good way to create this macro.

Git
  Git. Make it happen now.
